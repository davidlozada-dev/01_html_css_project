#### Technologies/tools used for this project
	
	1. CSS

### 1.2 Landing page layouts

#### Desktop view

The __desktop view__ is composed by three parts; firstly, the header which holds four buttons on the top-right side and a nintendo logo on the top-left side. Secondly, the middle part shows a game controller and "add to car" butoon on the right side, while a brief description of the product and a animated button is shown on the left side. Finally, the footer which holds social media icons.

#### Mobile View

The __mobile view__ manages the same parts as the desktop view with the difference that the header doesn't hold the four buttons shown on the top-right desktop view. Instead, it holds a dropdown menu button and when it's clicked on it displays the four options as in the desktop view.
